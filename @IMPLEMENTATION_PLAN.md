# Implementation Plan – Nexus Consulting Smart City Dashboard

## Objectives
- Deliver a production-grade GIS dashboard that convinces smart-city executives Nexus Consulting already operates a full AI/ML command center.
- Showcase digital twin interactions, automated VLR workflows, citywide KPIs, and explainable AI insights inside an immersive, responsive canvas.
- Keep the stack frontend-only while grounding every module in realistic datasets, spatial layers, and analytical storytelling.

## Task Backlog (ordered by priority)
1. **GIS Canvas Visibility Refresh** _(✅ Completed)_
   - Brightened the base tiles and overlays so the city map reads clearly on first paint.
   - Slimmed the HUD chips and marker callouts so spatial data stays unobstructed.
   - Tuned layer opacity and focus styling to keep choropleths, flows, and pins crisp on the light theme.

2. **Scenario Module Simplification** _(✅ Completed)_
   - Centered the digital twin module on the map with slim signal, AI note, and next-step cards.
   - Rewrote scenario taglines, commands, and AI copy in plain language tailored to SDG localization, VLR automation, and city profiling.
   - Removed redundant spotlight and legend blocks to deliver a calmer Notion-like layout.

3. **Analytics & Data Fabric Focus Pass** _(✅ Completed)_
   - Curated the AI pipeline tab to three focused panels covering forecasts, wellbeing, and evidence follow-ups in calm plain language.
   - Rebuilt the Data Fabric module around connector health, automation runs, and quality alerts with clean, Notion-inspired styling.
   - Rewrote playbooks and guardrail copy so every card describes practical AI-supported tasks city teams can action immediately.

4. **Top Bar & Navigation Polish** _(✅ Completed)_
   - Slimmed the intelligence bar with lighter padding, balanced typography, and a compact Nexus brand block.
   - Introduced shared status-chip styling and a calmer scenario picker to keep the header breathable.
   - Softened the module tab rail with simplified pills and icon treatment, confirming responsive behaviour across breakpoints.

5. **Experience QA & Build** _(✅ Completed)_
   - Reviewed the Digital Twin module and map composition to confirm layers, highlights, and companion cards stay visible on the light theme.
   - Ran `npm run lint` with no findings and `npm run build` to validate a clean production bundle.
   - Logged verification results so the demo handoff reflects the current state.

Your task is to create a beautiful frontend in  next js showcasing an amazing GIS app for smart cities using AI/ML and data science visuals. This is simple: no backend is needed, simply create a world class GIS frontend that when a prospective client sees it, says wow, they're doing this kind of GIS analysis using AI? I want to hire them. That's it.

You will work off of @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, which is a list of all tasks that are needed in order to generate the COMPLETE cleanroom specifications that can be used to implement from scratch. If not created, create it yourself and make it as comprehensive as possible with all the tasks as lists in detail organized when you create it and add as you see fit tasks. After completing step 0-3 for a SINGLE task, follow that process strictly and end it. If exists, continue working on the tasks.

0a. read everything in specs/ 
0b. review any existing files in src/

Completely ignore the loop.sh file and never execute it.

1. pick the SINGLE highest priority item from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement it using up to 50 subagents
2. ensure the tests and checks are passing
3. update the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your progress and commit all changes with git add -A && git commit -m "..."

if there is a discrepancy in the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and the spec, always update the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to match the spec.

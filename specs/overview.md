All focused on AI for smart cities, how to handle smart cities, how to improve city functioning, twin cities, etc.. any particular module that is commong for this type of analysis

It should have some cool maps

It should have hardcoded any cool AI/ML visuals that are usually used in GIS projects with AI

It should not have any backend, this is just for show off.

Add any other feature that makes this wow and cool. Aim fora sleek design using world class visuals and UI best practices

NEW UPDATE:

Focus on dashboards, interactive dahsboards, the real product, no tthe landing page. And make this dashboard focus on AI/ML as applied to digital twins (with GIS plots, actual real use cases for cities) where they can play around with the actual real dashboard and see predictions / heatmaps, etc.. One particular products are VLR, voluntary local review but fully AI automated and any cool GIS analysis for cities using AI but from an applied perpsective, a real dashboard. Call it under the company 'Nexus Consulting'. The idea is we have full working product you've worked and planned so that they can say oh wow, this dashbaords does full VLRs using AI, we have inermediated samples and steps to see results, the process loading and working using AI, getting feedback, etc.. but we also have other modules for doing GIS on cities for particular use cases, but fully developed and interactive for a particular city and other analytics modules for doing smart cities. Keep it frontend only, remember but make it like a world class dashboard fully interactive and ready to sue as if it were comissioned by a world class city showing real use cases of actual use cases for doing smart cities.

NEWER UPDATE:

Make the top sidebar height smaller, make the map have actual points and con be seen in the contx of an analysis of some sort. Make the modules separate tabs and make the full aesthetics kinda like notion/apple in terms of visuals, colors, fonts, etc...
